## 📸 What is GitGram?  
**GitGram** is where **Instagram meets GitHub**.  
Imagine browsing GitHub data in a smooth **Instagram-like feed**.  
- Instead of photos → you scroll through **repositories** 📂  
- Instead of stories → you see **GitHub activities & news** 📰  
- Instead of likes → you count **stars ⭐**  
- Instead of followers on IG → you see your **GitHub followers & following** 👥  
All packed inside a native **SwiftUI app** with the look & feel of Instagram.

## 🔥 Features  
- 🏠 **Home Feed** → Shows GitHub activity/news from your friends (commits, PRs, stars).  
- 📂 **Repos as Posts** → Your repositories displayed beautifully like Instagram posts.  
- 👥 **Followers & Following** → See who follows you (and who you follow) on GitHub.  
- 👤 **Profile Page** → Displays your GitHub profile in an Instagram-style layout.  
- 🌙 **Dark/Light Mode** → Full support for iOS system appearance.
