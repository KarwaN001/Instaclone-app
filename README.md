## 📸 What is GitGram?  

**GitGram** is where **Instagram meets GitHub**.  
Imagine browsing GitHub data in a smooth **Instagram-like feed**.  

- Instead of photos → you scroll through **repositories** 📂  
- Instead of stories → you see **GitHub activities & news** 📰  
- Instead of likes → you count **stars ⭐**  
- Instead of followers on IG → you see your **GitHub followers & following** 👥  

All packed inside a native **SwiftUI app** with the look & feel of Instagram.
